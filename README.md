About the Sales Forecasting Model:
This project focuses on forecasting sales trends using the Facebook Prophet model, applied to a dataset containing sales data across various product lines. The model aims to predict future sales while capturing seasonality, trends, and holidays.

Model: Facebook Prophet

Overall Performance:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 7657.28
MSE (Mean Squared Error): 116,668,970.30
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 10,801.34

Accuracy (R² Score): 42.46%

Deliverables:
Forecasting Visualization: Displays actual vs. forecasted sales.
Components Analysis: Shows trend, seasonality, and holiday effects.

Residuals Analysis: Evaluates model errors to ensure performance consistency.

Key Learnings:
The model captures long-term trends reasonably well, though further fine-tuning could enhance accuracy.
Prophet’s automated handling of seasonality and changepoints made it easy to implement for time series forecasting.
The project offers valuable insights into sales performance and helps in future decision-making by identifying potential growth patterns.
